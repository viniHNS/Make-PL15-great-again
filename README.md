#### [EN](README.md) | [PT_BR](README_BR.md)
## What is this? 

This is a mod for [SPT-AKI](https://www.sp-tarkov.com "The project's main goal is to provide a separate offline singleplayer experience with progression out-of-the-box for BSG's official client. You can now play Escape From Tarkov while you're waiting for their servers to get back online, while you're disconnected from the internet or if you need to take a break from the cheaters.") that makes the PL-15 great again!

## What this mod does?

The PL-15 is a great weapon, but it has some flaws. This mod aims to fix them, like:

- Now you can use glock sights and some sight mounts
###### Because according to wikipedia: "The PL-15{...} features removable front and rear dovetail sight posts, completely interchangeable with sights designed for Glock pistols."
- Change the deviation (MOA) of the weapon

## Installation

1.  Download the `makepl15greatagain.zip`.
2.  Drag and drop the `.zip` file directly into the root folder of your SPT installation.
3.  Right-click the `.zip` file and select **"Extract Here"**.
4.  The folders should merge automatically. If you get a prompt to overwrite files, say yes.
